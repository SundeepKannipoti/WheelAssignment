Create a widget which looks like cart ðŸ›ž, user should be able to separate each sector of the wheel by press and hold and start dragging. Once the sector is separated from the wheel, initiate rotation of wheel with missing sector and meanwhile user should be able to drag separated sector. 

Drag feature should work only for a period of 15seconds, after which even if user is not releasing, separated sector should go and attach itself to the wheel and rotation of wheel should stop.

When ever separated sector is released it should follow back the traversed path and get attached to the wheel.(ie while dragging you should save the path of traversing)

Motion of traversing back can be set with different easing types by giving choice to user.
